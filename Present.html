	Nowadays, I just really enjoy hanging out and playing in the house. My adventures I take are fun, but there's always something to be said for enjoying a nice day with my family! I love playing and being a goofball with my owner Annemarie and playing fun games!

	Sometimes, I bug my owners a little bit because I wanna play with my friend Figs! The problem is, he's a snake and I guess I can't play with a snake because he will "bite" me or something... What a shame huh! Oh well, I'll get to meet him one day and that will make it all worth it! My life now is so great!
