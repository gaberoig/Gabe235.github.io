	<P> I like to travel up to camp! I get to play in the cabin and run around outside in the woods! </P>
	<P> The most fun thing about camp is looking at the pretty scenes, I get to play in the water and even 
		visit cool places in the woods. My owners also make big fires where we can play and eat their leftovers! </P>
	<P> But as you see above, my most favorite part is the car ride up and back, because a kitty like me
		needs his beauty rest so I can be crazy afterwards!</P>
