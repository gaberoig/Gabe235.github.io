	When I was little, I lived with a lady who found my mom on the street; she picked her up and brought her back home.
	I was born with a brother and two sisters, and I really liked playing with them but I was always the most energetic one
	out of all of us, so I always wanted to play when they were tired! Then the lady who found my mom called people who wanted
	new cats and found my new owners! I'm happy these people picked me.
