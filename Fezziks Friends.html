	I have 3 really good friends here where I live! I have Pudds the pup, she's loud and proud but all she likes to do is have fun and explore the woods and such! Next, I have Lily, she's an older dog but she loves to play and run all around the woods when we go camping! Then finally I guess we have Figs the corn snake..? I didn't even know he was here until like a week ago, but I bet he's a buddy!

	I really like all of the adventures me and the dogs take! We go outside and play with the bouncy balls, we go up to camp and play in the lake, and we just enjoy lounging around the house and playing on the furniture too.
